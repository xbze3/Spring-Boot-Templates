# Spring Boot Templates

Some things in Spring Boot can be tedious to implement from scratch.
To save time and stay consistent, I created a few simple, focused templates tailored to common needs like JWT security, MongoDB integration, and user authentication.

These templates are meant to be easy to customize and extend for your own projects.

Contributions and improvements are very welcome.
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to help make these templates better for everyone.
